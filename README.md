# Dog-Rescue-System
Third-year project

A Dog Rescue center is looking to streamline its existing paper-based application procedure.

You should create a resource that facilitates the adoption process, which includes the vet checks of the dog, the application by the prospective adoptors, the checking of their house by video call or in person by a house check volunteer, the preparation of the travel from shelter to home, and the notification of various updates.

Ideally, users would be able to view dogs available for adoption, to log in and manage their adoption application, and to manage other aspects of the process (if permissions allow)
